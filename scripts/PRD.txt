# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title
Agno Customer Service RAG Agent Platform

## Overview
Build a customer-facing support agent using the Agno framework. The initial version will use a single Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent to answer support queries. The system will be architected for extensibility, allowing for the addition of specialized agents and agent teams as requirements grow.

## Goals
- Deploy a customer service RAG agent using Agno (core, API, and UI repos)
- Provide accurate, context-aware answers to customer support queries
- Optimize the RAG pipeline over time by introducing specialized agents (to be determined)
- Design for seamless expansion to agent teams and new support workflows (e.g., ticket submission)
- Maintain modularity and scalability throughout

## Initial Scope
- Implement a single customer-facing RAG agent using Agno
- Integrate with Agno API backend and Agno UI frontend
- Provide support query answering via web chat interface
- Ensure the system is easy to extend with additional agents and workflows

## Out of Scope (for initial version)
- Multi-agent teams (will be added after RAG agent is proven)
- Ticket submission or advanced workflow automation (future milestones)

## Future Scope (after successful RAG deployment)
- Add specialized agents for improved RAG (e.g., knowledge, escalation, sentiment analysis)
- Implement agent teams for complex workflows (e.g., ticketing, escalation, analytics)
- Expand support channels and integrations as needed
- Build and deploy a customer-facing chat widget/app for end users, integrated with the Agno backend

## Tech Stack
- Agno core (Python)
- Agno API (FastAPI, Postgres)
- Agno UI (Next.js, TypeScript)

## Key Requirements
- Use latest versions of Agno core, API, and UI
- All Python code in a virtual environment
- All work tracked and managed via Task Master (tasks, subtasks, status)
- Precision: implement exactly what is specified, no extras
- Follow official documentation for setup and dependencies

## Open Questions
- What data sources will the RAG agent use for retrieval (e.g., support docs, knowledge base)?
- What authentication or access control is needed for the customer-facing UI?
- What are the expected support query types and volume?
- Are there specific integrations or APIs required for future ticketing workflows?

## Next Steps
1. Parse this PRD into tasks and subtasks using Task Master.
2. Implement the initial RAG agent and web interface.
3. Gather feedback and iterate on agent/team design as requirements evolve.
